= Ledger Design

The Atto ledger employs a decentralized architecture, where each account maintains its own chain of transactions.
This structure enables rapid, concurrent processing across the network, eliminating bottlenecks associated with traditional blockchain designs.

Transactions in Atto are individualized, meaning each transaction forms a block within an account's chain, streamlining the process from initiation to confirmation.
This method ensures immediate transaction propagation and verification, enhancing user experience and network efficiency.

In conclusion, Atto's ledger design focuses on speed, scalability, and security, providing a robust foundation for the digital currency.
